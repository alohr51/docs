== Overview
Developers expect high-quality open source tools to be available in their IDE of choice. To deliver on this, we’ve started putting the local Microclimate installation on a diet and contributed it to a new Eclipse project that we’ve helped to form: Eclipse Codewind. Today we’re happy to announce a first glimpse of what Codewind will look like. This preview shows the state of the codebase as it begins the move to Eclipse.

Why Eclipse? That’s easy - it’s because the Eclipse Foundation has a strong history and community around building vendor-agnostic developer tools. Eclipse also hosts two of the main IDEs that we plan to extend, making it a natural fit for Codewind.

The initial contribution for Codewind is coming from Microclimate. The Eclipse plug-in and Visual Studio Code extension are already open source and licensed under EPL 2. The common library that these depend on (a Docker container for now) has been relicensed under EPL 2 and is in the process of being legally cleared to release at Eclipse. All future releases of Codewind will come from the Eclipse codebase - we hope to see you there soon!

== Limitations
This preview is only available to use on Apple Mac (macOS).

You must run a local installer (which installs almost 1 Gb of Docker containers - we’re working on it!) in addition to the IDE plug-in/extension.

Projects must be located in `<user>/microclimate-workspace`.

== Prerequisites
* Docker
* Git
* VS Code or Eclipse
* Either uninstall Microclimate or prevent the Microclimate images from running. 
** For more information about uninstalling Microclimate, see https://microclimate.dev/uninstalllinuxmac[Uninstalling Microclimate on Linux or Mac/OS, window="_blank"].

== Installing Codewind on MacOS
. Download https://microclimate.dev/download/codewind[codewind] to a folder on your system.
. Make the codewind file executable with: `chmod +x codewind`.
. Enter the `./codewind install` command in the Terminal.
. Run the `./codewind` command to see the available commands.

== Installing the VS Code extension

. Install https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[Visual Studio Code, window="_blank"] Version 1.27 or later.

. Install the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.codewind[Codewind VS Code extension, window="_blank"] from the VS Code Marketplace or by searching for `Codewind` in the VS Code Extensions view.

. *Optional*: If you plan to work on Java projects, also install the Java Extension Pack.

. After installing the extension, the Codewind view is available in the Explorer view and the Command Palette. In the VS Code Explorer view group, open the Codewind view, or enter Focus on Codewind into the Command Palette.

== Installing the Eclipse plug-in
. Download and install the https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/[latest Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers, window="_blank"] or use an existing installation. The earliest supported version of the Eclipse IDE is Version 2019-03 (4.11).
. Obtain the https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/codewind[Codewind plug-in, window="_blank"] in one of the following ways:
.. Drag this install button http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=4638524[image:https://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/themes/solstice/public/images/marketplace/btn-install.png[Eclipse drag and drop install button]] to your running Eclipse workspace. Note: You need to have the Eclipse Marketplace Client.
.. Open the https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/codewind[Eclipse IDE] and go to *Help > Eclipse Marketplace*. Then, search for Codewind. Click *Install* and finish the wizard and accept licenses as prompted.
. When the installation is complete, restart Eclipse.
. Open the Codewind Explorer view. Go to *Window > Show View > Other* and type Codewind in the filter field. Then, select *Codewind Explorer* and click *Open*.
